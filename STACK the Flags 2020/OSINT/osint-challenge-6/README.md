Prompt: "This picture was taken sent to us! It seems like a bomb threat! Are you able to tell where and when this photo was taken? This will help the investigating officers to narrow down their search! All we can tell is that it's taken during the day!

If you think that it's 7.24pm in which the photo was taken. Please take the associated 2 hour block. This will be 1900-2100. If you think it is 10.11am, it will be 1000-1200.

## My Attempt


## **Learning Resources/References:**
- My simplified workflow is as follows:
1) imageinfo
2) pslist/pstree
3) memdump interesting processes
4) Run strings on memdump
5) Repeat the process, and make use of other modules as and when potential artefacts are identified
