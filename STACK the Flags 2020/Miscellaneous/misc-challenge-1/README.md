# Welcome Challenge
**Points: 1000**

Prompt: Welcome to STACK the Flags 2020! This is a welcome challenge to get you started. Can you find the flag hidden on our [website](https://ctf.tech.gov.sg/)? (Please DO NOT attack/scan the web service! The challenge does not require you to attack the site, subdomains, or root domain!)

Addendum:
Treat the website as a starting point. The goal is to gain enough prerequisite knowledge to be able to find the flag "on" the website. Treat this challenge similar to an OSINT challenge, find out more about the website.

## My Attempt
TBD

The flag is:
> **govtech-csg{C00L_SL0w_Sc4n_T3L3v1S1on_tR4nsM1ss10N}**
